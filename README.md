# MolScore: A scoring and evaluation framework for de novo drug design
![alt text](https://github.com/MorganCThomas/MolScore/blob/main/molscore/data/images/GraphAbv2.png?raw=True)
## Overview

The aim of this codebase is to simply and flexibly 
automate the scoring of *de novo* compounds in generative models via the subpackage `molscore`. As well as, facilitate evaluation downstream via the subpackage `moleval`. An objective is designed via a JSON file which can be shared to propose new benchmark objectives, or to conduct multi-parameter objectives for drug design.

Custom scoring functions can be implemented following the guidelines [here](https://github.com/MorganCThomas/MolScore/blob/main/molscore/scoring_functions/README.MD)

Contributions and/or ideas for added functionality are welcomed!

This code here was used in the following publications:

## Installation
Conda can be used to install the molscore environment, mamba is considerably faster though.
```
git clone https://github.com/MorganCThomas/MolScore.git
cd MolScore
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate molscore
python setup.py develop
```
## Implementation into a generative model

Implementing `molscore` is as simple as importing it, instantiating it (pointing to the configuration file) and then scoring molecules. This should easily fit into most generative model pipelines.

```python
from molscore.manager import MolScore

# Instantiate MolScore, assign the model name and point to configuration file describing the objective
ms = MolScore(model_name='test', task_config='molscore/configs/QED.json')
              
# Calling it simply scores a list of smiles (SMILES) - to be integrated into a for loop during model optimization
scores = ms.score(SMILES)
    
# When the program exits, all recorded smiles will be saved and the monitor app (if selected) will be closed
```

## Usage
Once `molscore` has been implemented into a generative model, the objective needs to be defined! Writing a JSON file is a pain though so instead a streamlit app is provided do help.

```
streamlit run molscore/gui/config.py
```

Once the configuration file is saved, simply point to this file path and run *de novo* molecule optimization. If running with the monitor app you'll be able to investigate molecules as they're being generated. This can also be run manually with `streamlit run molscore/gui/monitor.py`.
