# MolScore: A scoring and evaluation framework for de novo drug design
![alt text](https://github.com/MorganCThomas/MolScore/blob/v1.0/molscore/data/images/GraphAbv2.png?raw=True)
## Overview

The aim of this codebase is to simply and flexibly 
automate the scoring of *de novo* compounds in generative models via the subpackage `molscore`. As well as, facilitate evaluation downstream via the subpackage `moleval`. An objective is designed via a JSON file which can be shared to propose new benchmark objectives, or to conduct multi-parameter objectives for drug design.

Custom scoring functions can be implemented following the guidelines [here](https://github.com/MorganCThomas/MolScore/blob/main/molscore/scoring_functions/README.MD)

Contributions and/or ideas for added functionality are welcomed!

## Installation
Mamba should be used to install the molscore environment as it is considerably better than conda. If you do not have mamba first install this package manager following the instructions [here](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#mambaforge).
```
git clone https://github.com/MorganCThomas/MolScore.git
cd MolScore
mamba env create -f environment.yml
mamba activate molscore
python setup.py develop
```
**Note:** Depending if you have conda already installed, you may have to use `conda activate` instead and point to the env path directly for example, `conda activate ~/mambaforge/envs/molscore`

## Tests
Unittests are currently available for some functionality, but not all.
```
cd molscore/tests
python -m unittest
```

Or any individual test, for example
```
python test_docking.py
```
## Implementation into a generative model

Implementing `molscore` is as simple as importing it, instantiating it (pointing to the configuration file) and then scoring molecules. This should easily fit into most generative model pipelines.

```python
from molscore.manager import MolScore

# Instantiate MolScore, assign the model name and point to configuration file describing the objective
ms = MolScore(model_name='test', task_config='molscore/configs/QED.json')
              
# Calling it simply scores a list of smiles (SMILES) - to be integrated into a for loop during model optimization
scores = ms.score(SMILES)
    
# When the program exits, all recorded smiles will be saved and the monitor app (if selected) will be closed
```

**Note: A generative language model with MolScore already implemented can be found [here](https://github.com/MorganCThomas/SMILES-RNN).**

## Usage
Here is a GIF demonstrating writing a config file with the help of the GUI, running MolScore in a mock example (scoring randomly sampled SMILES), and monitoring the output with another GUI.

Once `molscore` has been implemented into a generative model, the objective needs to be defined! Writing a JSON file is a pain though so instead a streamlit app is provided do help. Simply call `molscore_config` from the command line (a simple wrapper to `streamlit run molscore/gui/config.py`)

Once the configuration file is saved, simply point to this file path and run *de novo* molecule optimization. If running with the monitor app you'll be able to investigate molecules as they're being generated. Simply call `molscore_monitor` from the command line (a wrapper to `streamlit run molscore/gui/monitor.py`).
