  - IFP rescoring    # Add n_poses and IFP to __init__ of each docking program, need to pre-select binding site residues ... 
    - ICHEM IFP http://bioinfo-pharma.u-strasbg.fr/labwebsite/download.html # Same as PLIF, academicly free but need a license X
    - PLIF  http://bioinfo-pharma.u-strasbg.fr/labwebsite/download.html  # Free but relies on openeye X
    - PROLIF https://prolif.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/installation.html # Nice python API for FPs, residue-based interactions
    - SPLIF https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/ci500319f # PLIF + substructure, i.e., specific interaction encoded
    - PyPLIF https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3607193/ # Command line & Python?
    - PyPLIFHIPPOS https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jcim.0c00305 # Uses PyPLIF
    - BINANA https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jcim.1c01461  # Not necessarily FP based, just ligand interactions  X
    - 2D SIFT https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13321-021-00545-9  # Includes 1D fingerprint representation, seems to rely on schrodinger X
  - Shape-it/align-it open-source shape matching

  - Implement pareto pair and pareto fronts
  - Adapt st_monitor to save PLANTS and GOLD mol files
  - Applicability domain filters
  - Implement PIDGIN models
  - AttentiveFP

- MolScore
  - Have filters as any scoring function / diversity filter, multiplying aggregated function?
  - Move diversity filter to cluster df, are we doing it twice?
  - Move reading configs to a seperate method, then can do it adaptively?

- MolScore I/O
  - Accept smiles or rdkit mols -> pass mols to docking, conformations etc.
  - Multiple score output mode e.g., MPO scores
  - Write json schema to validate config files

- MolScore GUI
  - Change scoring functions to dropdown menu
  - Choose to add or delete individual SFs
  - Sidebar to navigate conf?
  - Adapt st_monitor to save PLANTS and GOLD mol files
  - Extra page to filter generated compounds?
  - Functionality to assess multiple runs?

- MolScore tests
 - Write unit tests
 - Test and ligand preparation for oedock ... wait for license

- Adaptive rewards
  - Adaptive rewards, app write new configs, molscore read new configs, keep trace of reward shaping over time, monitor out-params.json at each step in __call__
  - Alternating rewards (MoleGuLaR, Curriculum learning), list / directory of configs upfront along with steps to make change? Just show changes or completely update configs? Exceptions, what is and isn't allowed to change?

- Benchmarking mode, do several config files by directory? Bash template file? Path to preset tasks? 

- AiZynthFinder

- Refactor
  - Move generative models to seperate folder
  - Move MolEval to seperate folder?
  - Implement some other generative models, CharGNN, HierG2G, PS, STONED, JTVAE, GCPN, molDQN^ etc.? (From PMO?)
  - Setup versioning / releases

- MolEval
  - Check pre-computation of statistics ... it may be helpful to be able to run this with moses FCD?

- Nice to have
  - Add template dask-jobqueue for HPC? https://jobqueue.dask.org/en/latest/

- Move automatic starting of streamlit (???)
